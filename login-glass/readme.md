# Glassmorphism Login Form using Html & CSS 

This is my redesign to the tutorial Glassmorphism Login Form using Html & CSS from the Online Tutorial Youtube Channel. 

The original was beautiful, but I wanted to give it a more delicate and sophisticated touch in the details and color palette. 

I also added shadows on some items (Forgot passord and Sign Up) to improve readability in some browsers.
